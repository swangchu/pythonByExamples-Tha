# This example demonstrates use of for loops 

# This for loop prints “Om Mani payme hung!” five times.
# i will iterate from 0 till 5. 

for i in range(5):
  
     print(“Om Mani payme hung!”)
 



# This for loop prints number from 0 to 4

for i in range(5):
  
     print(i)
    
# Output : 0 1 2 3 4



# This for loop from 2 to 9
# 2 is the starting number and 10 is the end number but excluded. 
# By default the value increases by 1

for j in range(2,10):
  
     print(j)
    
# Output: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9



# This for loop starts from 1 and end less than 10.
# 3 represents steps with which the number increases.

for k in range(1,10,3):
  
     print(k)
    
# Output: 1 4 7
