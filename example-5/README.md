Follow the sequence as given below to learn better.

1. **strings folder** contains example for use of strings and its methods in Python.

    A sequence of characters is called a string in Python. Strings are enclosed in double quote.
    
    There are many methods to manipulate a string.
    
        Method      |  Description
        ----------------------------------
        upper()     | converts to uppercase
        lower()     | converts to lowercase
        swapcase()  | cases are swaped
        strip()     | remove whitespace before and after a string
        find()      | returns the index
        split()     | splits a string into words at whitespace

2. **List folder** contains list and ways to access its elements

    We use list to store more than one values.

    Creating a List

    We create list by putting the items inside a square bracket. List can be
    empty too.


            red | green | blue | yellow
            ---------------------------
            0   |1      |  2   |  3

    We can access items of the list through their index. Index begins from zero.
    We also use loops to display its items.
    
3. **listMethod folder** contains a example for list methods

    List methods help us manipulate with a list.
    
        Some of the methods are:
        Method         |        Description
        ----------------------------------------------------
        append()       | adds an item or another list
        pop()          | removes a item
        index()        | returns the index of the first match.
        sort()         | returns a sorted list
        reverse()      | returns a reverse list
        count()        | return the number of an item in the list
        extend()       | adds a list to the list
        remove()       | removes a particular item
