**Example 5**

Follow the sequence as given below to learn better.

1. **strings folder** contains example for use of strings and its methods in Python.

    A sequence of characters is called a string in Python. Strings are enclosed in double quote.
    
    There are many methods to manipulate a string.
    
        Method      |  Description
        ----------------------------------
        upper()     | converts to uppercase
        lower()     | converts to lowercase
        swapcase()  | cases are swaped
        strip()     | remove whitespace before and after a string
        find()      | returns the index
        split()     | splits a string into words at whitespace

2.** List folder** contains list and ways to access its elements

    We use list to store more than one values.
    
    _Creating a List_
    
    We create list by putting the items inside a square bracket. List can be
    empty too.
    
        red | green | blue | yellow
        ---------------------------
        0   |1      |  2   |  3
    We can access items of the list through their index. Index begins from zero.
    We also use loops to display its items.
