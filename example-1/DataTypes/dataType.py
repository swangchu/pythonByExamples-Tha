# This example prints out different data types
# ----------------------

# totalSubject is variable stores a value 4 
# so the data type of totalSubject is an integer
totalSubject = 4  

# Since variable averageMark stores 78.5 so the data type is a float
averageMark = 78.5 

# The variable studentName stores "Gaki Pelzom" which is a string data type
studentName= "Gaki Pelzom" 

# The variable qualified stores value true which is boolean data type
qualified = true  

# When we use variable it should be in double quote
print(totalSubject)

print(averageMark)

print(studentName)

print(“Qualified ”,qualified)
