1. **Tuple folder** contains example for use of tuple data type in Python.

    - We use tuple to store data which we donâ€™t want to change in future.
    - We create a tuple by putting items inside parenthesis.
    - We can access the items using their index.

2. **TupleMethod folder** contains example for use of tuple methods in Python.

    - There is no method to add or remove items from tuple. 
    - Tuple has two methods.

            Method    |     Description
            ------------------------------------------------
            count()   | returns the count of items in a tuple
            index()   | returns the index of a item

3. **Dictionary folder** contains example for use of dictionary data type in Python.

    - Dictionaries have a collection of key- value pair.
    - The pairs are enclosed in curly brackets as show below.
    
            { key1: value1, key2: value2 }      
    - To access the value we write dictionary name followed by the key in a square bracket.
