**Example 4**

Follow the sequence as given below to learn better.

1. **breakContinue folder** contains example for use of continue and break statement in Python.

    - We use break and continue to change the flow of a loop.
    - Break terminates the loop and control passes to next statement.
    - Continue skips a block of code in a loop but does not terminates the loop

2. **whileLoop folder** contains example for use of while loop in Python.

    - The while loop keeps on repeating till the condition becomes false.
    - We use while loop when we want to repeat block of code for unknown numbers of times.

          In while loop there should be:
          1. Initialization ( x = 0)
          2. condition (x < 5)
          3. Increment or decrement (x = x + 1)
