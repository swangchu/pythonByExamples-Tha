**Example 4**

Follow the sequence as given below to learn better.

1. **breakContinue folder** contains example for use of continue and break statement in Python.

    - We use break and continue to change the flow of a loop.
    - Break terminates the loop and control passes to next statement.
    - Continue skips a block of code in a loop but does not terminates the loop

2. **whileLoop folder** contains example for use of while loop in Python.

    - The while loop keeps on repeating till the condition becomes false.
    - We use while loop when we want to repeat block of code for unknown numbers of times.

          In while loop there should be:
          1. Initialization ( x = 0)
          2. condition (x < 5)
          3. Increment or decrement (x = x + 1)
          
3. **practice-1-while folder** contains example practice while loop in Python.

    - This code will continue printing Kuzuzangpola as long as the user enters “yes”.
    - The while loop will stop only when the user enters other than yes.

4. **practice-2-while folder** contains example practice while loop in Python.

    - he variable x is of boolean data type. True is assigned to it.
    - Hello, World will be printed only once.
    - The variable x is assigned False. This makes while condition false.
    
5. **randomNumber folder** contains example uses random module in Python.

    - Python has many functions that generates random number. 
    - To use random module we have to import random module in our code.
    - random.randint(1,10) generate a random number between 1 and 10.
    - random.choice() generates one element in the sequence.

6. **Project-4 folder** contains project 4 which uses all the concepts learned so far. 

    Program to generate a random number and gets a number from the user. Check if the two numbers are equal. 
    If the user entered number is higher or lower than the random number tell the user about it. 
    The program gives choice to the user to terminate the loop.

7. **Project-5 folder** contains project 5 which uses all the concepts learned so far. 

    Program to simulate Lottery system. The program generates an alphanumeric, an alphabet followed by a number, and compares with user ticket of same format.
    If the computer generated ticket is same as user’s ticket than display you won message. Other display a message of regret.
